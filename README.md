# Final project

**Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.**
The general theme was to create a sort of doubly-linked list, where user access was had with both a head and a tail pointer. Additionally, there are two ways of forming and inserting into a list, with cons adding to the front and snoc adding to the end. This set up provides all of the normal features as List in Agda, as well as some others. There are two versions of take in the code, one returns the number of elements desired from the front of the list, and the other from the back. The ListEq data structure aided in proving lists as equal, and the code following that incorporated the normal List Builtin in Agda. 


**Cite any resources or existing code you used.**
I referenced the List work we did in class a lot and used ChatGPT to formulate ideas of functions to add in order to make the list as functional as possible. Anytime I did this however, answers were not given, only skeleton code. 


**Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.**
I am stuck on the last blank I had, I could not figure out a way to fill it in or come up with a helper function that aided it.
